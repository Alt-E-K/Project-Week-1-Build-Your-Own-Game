## Project Description
My project consists of a function that allows for encoding and decoding of a (very simple) algorithm for encryption. It has some basic level of user interaction.

## Rules
It is simple, it asks whether you wish to encode or decode and returns the result.

## Workflow
1. Desining the algorithm.
2. Developing the pseudo-code or the flow of ideas in a file (Project Notes).
3. Breaking the idea in small parts and executing each one of them (way slower then it sounds)
4. Fixing the problems of this small parts
5. Figuring out how to make the parts work toghether and how to interact with the user.
6. Fixing these new problems (the slowest one by far)

## Organization
In the repository you will find:
 - Kick off.txt
 - .gitignore
 - subfolder with the project
 In which you will find
-  Draft of encoding
-  Project Notes
- Tentative Final Code
- README (you are here)
